<p><font size="5.5">Antivirus software is a program used to protect users' devices from malicious codes.
Antivirus softwares usually run in the background of your device, scanning and checking every file that is being opened.
Antivirus apps, may also check files that contain viruses, the moment they are stored-downloaded in your device and prevent you from opening the infected file.
All these happen without you being aware of what's going on in the background.

      Firewall is the first protection layer of your device against unauthorized access to your PC.

      and blocks certain ports while allows specific programs and services to communicate with your PC.</font></p>
