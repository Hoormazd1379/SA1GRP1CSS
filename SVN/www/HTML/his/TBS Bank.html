                            <h2 id="sect-title"> <p>April 2018</p> </h2>

                              TSB’s botched IT “upgrade” has snowballed into a full-scale crisis, with up to 1.9 million customers locked out of their accounts for a sixth day, MPs demanding action and the bank facing a potential multimillion-pound compensation bill and regulatory fines.

In one of the worst IT problems to hit Britain’s banking sector in years, TSB took all its internet and mobile services offline for emergency repair work, after a migration to a new platform over the weekend backfired.

                <p>TSB’s chief executive, Paul Pester, apologised for the chaos on Tuesday morning, promising that services would resume by the afternoon and that <q>no one will be left out of pocket as a result of these service issues</q>.

TSB battles to fix online banking after days of disruption business live

But at the end of the working day, and with TSB branches closed, customers were still unable to access their accounts online. Customers reported waiting for more than an hour to get through to the phone banking service. Owners of small businesses said they were unable to pay salaries or manage transactions, while some account holders found all their direct debits had disappeared.
In TSB branches, some customers were told it could be another 48 hours before they could access their accounts properly, while the bank’s website said some issues, such as one-time passwords and Isa transfers, would be fixed by the end of April.
While most TSB account holders had been able to continue using their debit cards to make payments and withdraw cash from ATMs, many alleged the problems were deeper than the bank was admitting.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5wvYnvj4kE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="margin: 50px;"></iframe>
<h2 id="sect-title"> The Impact </h2>

<p>TSB has revealed that last year’s massive IT failure cost the bank £330m, while 80,000 customers switched their account to a competitor,
the bank reported a loss of £105.4m for 2018, compared with a profit of £162.7m in 2017, and said this reflected <q>the impact of the issues following the bank’s IT migration</q>.
The £330m total spent by TSB to address the IT failure was made up of £125m in customer payouts, fraud and operational losses of £49m, the cost of fixing the tech systems, which was £122m, and £34m in income lost due to waived fees and charges incurred because of the disruption.</p>
