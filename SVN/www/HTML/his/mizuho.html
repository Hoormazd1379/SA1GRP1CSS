                                As part of the finance-industry reorganization, Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and Industrial
                                Bank of Japan Ltd. were consolidated into Mizuho Bank Ltd. and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. under the
                                management of Mizuho Holding in Tokyo. The new Mizuho Bank's first day in business (April 1, 2002) was
                                tarnished by the ATM (automatic teller machine) transaction errors in which debits were made from accounts
                                although customers did not receive cash from the machine, as well as un processed scheduled automatic debits
                                for utility and credit card bills. The banking system failed to process 105,000 automatic debits scheduled for
                                April 1. Delayed debits backlogged, and the number of delayed debits reached 2.5 million by the end of April 5.
                                An additional 30,000 double debits were found between April 1 and April 5. The biggest banking system failure in history
                                caused chaos, from which the recovery took more than one month until the bank's operations went completely back to normal.

                                People were unable to withdraw their money and this caused hardships to customers life.
                                Today almost everyone has a personal computer or a smartphone with internet connection that
                                can be used to access bank account and complete transactions online. In 2002 it wasn't so easy.
                                Also having a credit card wasn't so common. Even doing the shopping became a problem for over a month!
