                In 1985 a British team of scientists discovered a significant reduction in the amount of ozone over Halley Bay in Anartica, by 40 %. This came as a shock to the scientific cummunity, as it was expected that the the ozone had to be depleted in the upper levels of the stratoshpere before &ndash; which was not seen &ndash; would occur before such a alrge reduction in amounts of ozone could take place.
                However, it was discovered that a reduction of ozone in the entire Anartica had actually been found 8 years prior &ndash; only that a bug caused the analysis software to ignore values that were deemed to deviate too greatly from expected values. Therefore no one noticed that abnormal values had been found for 8 whole years. <sup> (mb_1) </sup>

            <p class="H-OZONE-p2">
                The major impact of the bug has been that 8 years have been spent not knowing how quickly the ozone layer was diminishing. This meant that the rate at which ozone depletes was underestimated.

                It also resulted in a much more severe issue being created than if the fall in ozone had been discovered in a more timely manner.
                As the environment affects all beings on earth, this bug has undeniably had negative consequences for all of humanity. <sup> (mb_2) </sup>
