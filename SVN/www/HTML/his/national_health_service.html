<p class="H-NHS-p1"> I donâ€™t know what is worse: not taking your medicines at all or taking the wrong medication.
Either way, up to 22,000 heart patients every year were given the wrong drug or advise as a result
of a software fault. <br><br>

So, what happened? In the year 2018, it was discovered
some bug in the SystmOne clinical IT software, and since 2009 a number of patients were given
inaccurate assessment of their risk of heart disease, prompting the GPs to prescribe them
with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statin and this contribute to 20000 deaths a year. <br>
As a result, many patients suffered heart attacks or strokes since they were
told they were at low-risk, while other suffered from the side-effects of taking unnecessary
medication. <br> <br>
In a speech at the Global Patient Safety summit in London, Mr Hunt will say:
<p class="H-NHS-p2">"My mission
 has always been to make the NHS one of the safest healthcare systems - and although we
 do well in international comparisons, this new study shows medication error in the NHS
 and globally is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels
 of harm and death that are totally preventable.</p>

  <h2 id="sect-title">Solution</h2>
<p class="H-NHS-p3">
"We are taking a number of steps today, but part of the change needs also to be cultural:
moving from a blame culture to a learning culture so doctors and nurses are supported to be
open about mistakes rather than cover them up for fear of losing their job."</p><br><br>

<p class="H-NHS-p4">The Government's plans include accelerating the introduction of electronic-prescribing
 systems across the NHS - essentially robots replacing humans when selecting medication
- to cut down on errors.
New systems will also be introduced linking prescribing data in primary care to hospital
admissions to allow the NHS to see if a prescription was the likely cause of a patient
being admitted to hospital.</p>
