        <p class="H-NHS-p1"> I donâ€™t know what is worse: not taking your medication at all or taking the wrong medication.
        Either way, up to 22,000 heart patients every year were given the wrong drug or advice as a result
        of a software fault.

        <br>
        <br>


        So, what happened? In the year 2018, it was discovered that there was
        some bug in the SystmOne clinical IT software, and since 2009 a number of patients were given
        inaccurate assessment of their risk of heart disease, prompting the GPs to prescribe them
        with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statin and this contributes to 20000 deaths a year. <br>
        As a result, many patients suffered heart attacks or strokes since they were
        told they were at low-risk, while other suffered from the side-effects of taking unnecessary
        medication. <br> <br>
        In a speech at the Global Patient Safety summit in London, Mr Hunt said:
        </p>
        <p class="H-NHS-p2">"My mission
        has always been to make the NHS one of the safest healthcare systems - and although we
        do well in international comparisons, this new study shows medication error in the NHS
        and globally is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels
        of harm and death that are totally preventable.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p class="H-NHS-p3">
        "We are taking a number of steps today, but part of the change needs also to be cultural:
        moving from a blame culture to a learning culture so doctors and nurses are supported to be
        open about mistakes rather than cover them up for fear of losing their job."</p><br><br>

        <p class="H-NHS-p4">The Government has a plan consisting of: accelerating the introduction of electronic-prescribing
        systems. This will happend across all the NHS (essentially humans replaced by robots when selecting medication) to cut down on errors.
        This new system will also be introduced linking prescribing data in primary care to hospital
        admissions to allow the NHS. The aim is to see if a prescription was the likely cause of a patient
        being admitted to hospital.</p>
