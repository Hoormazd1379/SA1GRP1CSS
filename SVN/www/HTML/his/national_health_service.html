I donâ€™t know what is worse: Not taking your medicines at all or taking the wrong medication.
Either way, up to 20,000 heart patients every year were given the wrong drug or advise as a result
of a software fault.

So, what happened? In the year 2016, it was discovered
some bug in the SystmOne clinical IT software, and since 2009 a number of patients were given
inaccurate assessment of their risk of heart disease, prompting the GPs to prescribe them
with cholesterol-lowering drugs called statin and this contribute to 22000 deaths a year.
As a result, many patients suffered heart attacks or strokes since they were
told they were at low-risk, while other suffered from the side-effects of taking unnecessary
medication.

In a speech at the Global Patient Safety summit in London, Mr Hunt will say: "My mission
 has always been to make the NHS one of the safest healthcare systems - and although we
 do well in international comparisons, this new study shows medication error in the NHS
 and globally is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels
 of harm and death that are totally preventable.

"We are taking a number of steps today, but part of the change needs also to be cultural:
moving from a blame culture to a learning culture so doctors and nurses are supported to be
open about mistakes rather than cover them up for fear of losing their job."

The Government's plans include accelerating the introduction of electronic-prescribing
 systems across the NHS - essentially robots replacing humans when selecting medication
  - to cut down on errors.
New systems will also be introduced linking prescribing data in primary care to hospital
admissions to allow the NHS to see if a prescription was the likely cause of a patient
being admitted to hospital.
