                              On 9 May 2005 a military cargo plane on a test flight crashed in Spain, Seville, killing four crew members of six on board. Before the crash, pilots had reported that there were some technical problems and they asked permission to do an emergency land, but it failed.
                              The investigation reported that three of four engines of the aircraft failed during its departure: the crew tried to solve the problem, but not quickly enough for recovery to safe flight.
