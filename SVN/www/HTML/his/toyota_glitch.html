                              In the mid-2000’s many Toyota drivers were reporting that their car was accelerating without them touching the pedal. Investigators discovered that software errors were the cause of the unintended acceleration.

                              In this case, there was a series of things wrong with the software installed in Toyota cars: Memory corruption, wrong memory handling, disabling safety systems, systems with single points of failure, and thousands of global variables. Toyota recalled millions of vehicles and Toyota’s stock price decreased 20% a month after the cause of the problem was discovered. This case demonstrates the consequences of not giving enough attention to good programming practices and testing as a result of wanting to launch the product.

                              Toyota said that were recalled 997,000 Prius cars in Japan, some 713,000 in North America, another 130,000 in Europe and the rest in other regions of the world.

                              Fortunately, the car giant said that there had been no reports of crashes or injuries due to the software glitch. Despite the 2 million worldwide recalls, the company said in May that it expected to report a record net profit for the third year in a row in the current financial year.

                              The company did not disclose a cost estimate for the recall, which requires a software update taking less than an hour.

                              Multimillion vehicle car recalls have become increasingly common as carmakers share more and more parts and designs between models to cut down on costs, multiplying the impacts of a single faulty part.

                              The Prius recall also underlines the increased importance of software in modern cars, some of which boast more lines of computer code than a military fighter jet.

                              Toyota recalled more than 2 million Prius hybrids worldwide Friday over a software flaw that could in rare cases cause the cars to stall out at high speeds.The recall impacts about 2.4 million vehicles -- 1.25 million in Japan and 830,000 in North America, Toyota spokesman Jean-Yves Jault told Bloomberg Friday. About 807,000 are in the United States.
