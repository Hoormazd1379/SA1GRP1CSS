                              Nissan Motor Co Ltd recalled more than 3.5 million vehicles, most in the United States,
                              citing passenger-side air bags that may not work properly because vehicle sensors may malfunction.
                              The Japanese automaker said this was the fourth recall since 2013 to address problems with occupant
                              classification systems that may fail to properly identify adult front seat passengers.
                              The system may improperly classify an adult front seat passenger as a child or as an empty seat, a
                              failure that could lead to an air bag failing to deploy in the event of a crash.
                              Nissan has reports of three injuries linked to the issue, but no fatalities.</p>

                                  <p>The new recall includes vehicles from the 2013-2017 model years, including some Nissan Altima, Leaf,

                                    the 2015-2016 Chevrolet City Express, built for General Motors Co by Nissan.
                                    Nearly 3.2 million of the recalled vehicles are in the United States.<br>
                                    Nissan developed its remedy plan and began notifying dealers in late May.
                                    Only about 20 percent of the U.S. models needed a hardware fix.</p>

                                    The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration upgraded an investigation in August 2015 into the air bag
                                    deployment issue after reviewing 1,271 complaints and warranty claims to determine whether a prior Nissan recall
                                    adequately addressed the problem.<br>
                                    Most complaints from owners with repaired vehicles said the air bag deactivation light remained on even with an adult in the front seat.
                                    Nissan has issued several earlier recalls for occupant classification system issues in the United States in recent years.
                                    In 2014, the automaker recalled 990,000 U.S. vehicles to address the issue, expanding on a 2013 callback.
