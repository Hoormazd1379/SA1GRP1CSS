                               It was the first space probe launched from the United States of America to Venus. It was also the first of the Mariner program to be launched. It was launched for a planetary flight aboard an Atlas rocket. A month later the Mariner 2 was launched, built identical to the Mariner 1.

                              July 22, 1962 was the day of the start of the space mission to launch Mariner 1. From one glorious day it quickly turned into a disaster. In fact, shortly after takeoff the rocket no longer responded correctly to ground commands. The failure of the guidance system software then led to the self-destruction of the rocket.
                              Since the probable cause of mission failure is a coding problem, it was solved in time for the next Mariner 2 mission. In fact, the error had occurred when a symbol was being transcribed by hand in the specification for the guidance program.

                              An article by FastCompany explains what happened the July 22 1962:

                              “In the dark on Sunday morning, July 22, 1962, NASA launched the first-ever U.S. interplanetary space probe: Mariner 1, headed for Venus, Earth’s neighbor closer to the Sun.
                              Mariner 1 was launched atop a 103-foot-tall Atlas-Agena rocket at 5:21 a.m. EDT. For 3 minutes and 32 seconds, it rose perfectly, accelerating to the edge of space, nearly 100 miles up.
                              But at that moment, Mariner 1 started to veer in odd, unplanned ways, first aiming northwest, then pointing nose down. The rocket was out of control and headed for the shipping lanes of the North Atlantic. Four minutes and 50 seconds into flight,
                               a range safety officer at Cape Canaveral—in an effort to prevent the rocket from hitting people or land—flipped two switches, and explosives in the Atlas blew the rocket apart in a spectacular cascade of fireworks visible back in Florida.
                              The Mariner 1 probe itself was blown free of the debris, and its radio transponder continued to ping flight control for another 67 seconds, until it hit the Atlantic Ocean.”
