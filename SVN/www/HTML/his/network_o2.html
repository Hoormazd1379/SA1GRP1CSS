            <h2 class="">
                <p> 6/12/2018</p>
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p> Millions of furious O2 customers have endured a day without data services while some have also been unable to send texts.The network issues started about 5.30am yesterday with around 1,662 complaints made before 7am, and customers across Manchester, London and Southampton all reporting outages.Outraged customers of O2, which has a total of 32million users, took to social media to flag problems with 4G, data services and phone calls.

            But the issues also spread beyond England to Scotland and Northern Ireland, a heat map by the Down Detector website showed at the time.

            The network, which is also used by customers with Tesco Mobile, GiffGaff, Sky Mobile and Lycamobile, blamed the issue on faulty software provided by third party supplier Ericsson.

            The Swedish company has issued a statement saying it believes the issue was caused because of "an expired certificate in the software" installed with O2.The mobile company was forced to advise customers "to use wifi wherever they can" until services were fully restored.

        <h2 class="H-O2NET-subtitle"> Knock-on effects</h2>
        <p class="H-O2NET-p">The company said voice calls were not affected by the problem, but some O2 customers said they could not make calls or send texts either.

            The outage had knock-on effects for other services that use the O2 network, including Transport for London's electronic timetable service at bus stops, which stopped working.

            Tom Morrod at market research firm IHS Markit said data was increasingly important to consumers, with half of UK mobile users prioritising internet connectivity above calls and texts.</p>
