 The pair of probes "Mars Polar Lander" and "Mars Climate Orbiter" is part of NASA's Mars Surveyor program. The mission of the two probes in question is to study the meteorology, climate and quantities of water and carbon dioxide present on the planet Mars. The aim was to understand the reserves, behavior and atmospheric role of volatile substances and look for evidence of long-term climate change.

                                  <u> What happened:</u></p><br><p class="H-NMARS-pc">
Unfortunately, on November 23, 1999, NASA lost forever contact with the probe that was entering the atmosphere of Mars. It was later established that the probe entered the planet's atmosphere at too low an altitude where there was too high a density that caused the destruction of the space device. The cause of this miscalculation can be traced back to the software used during this mission. In fact, while the flight software on board correctly calculated the data, the software in the ground computers was written for another mission and therefore was not ready to receive this type of data. So it ignored them and recalculated them using an incorrect unit of measurement that led to the destruction of the space probe. The material value of the probe was $328 million.

                       In this article from New York Times is possible understand the opinion of some NASA’s workers:</p><br><p class="H-NMARS-article">

“An internal review team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a preliminary conclusion that engineers at the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which had built the spacecraft, specified certain measurements about the spacecraft's thrust in pounds, an English unit, but that NASA scientists thought the information was in the metric measurement of newtons.
The resulting miscalculation, undetected for months as the craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, was designed, built and launched, meant it was off course by about 60 miles as it approached Mars.
''This is going to be the cautionary tale that is going to be embedded into introductions to the metric system in elementary school and high school and college physics till the end of time,'' said John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.”
