                              THERACH is a radiation therapy machine.

                              Between 1985 and 1987 an accident caused the death of five patients and several
                              other injured.
                              The Therac-25 was a radiation therapy machine manufactured by AECL in the 80s. This machine works
                              with two modes of operation: firstly it delivers a low-power electron beam (beta particles) which kills
                              skin cancer, and secondly X-rays that involves penetrating deeper tissues (that can kill cancer cells in the lungs).
                              These room-sized medical devices would always cause some collateral damage to healthy tissue
                              around the tumors. As with chemotherapy, the hope is that the net effect heals the patient
                              more than it harms them.

                              Therac-25 was based upon a previous design of “Therac-20” and it relied on software controls to
                              switch between two modes.
                              At one point this radiation therapy device malfunctioned and delivered lethal radiation doses
                              at several medical facilities.
                              What engineers didn’t know was that both the 20 and the 25 were built upon an operations
                              system that had been kludged together by a programmer with no formal training.
                              Because of a subtle bug called “race condition”, a radiology technician had become very
                              quick at typing commands into the Therac-25 machine.  He accidentally entered “x” for X-Ray
                              rather than “e” for Electron, so pressed the up key to choose the correct mode. At this point
                              the machine fired the electron beam in high-power mode but with the metal X-ray target out
                              of position.

                            <p class="H-THERAC-p3">
                              Upon starting the program the machine shut down, displaying the error “Malfunction 54”. The
                              patient was receiving his 9th treatment, and immediately knew something had gone terribly wrong.
                              He reported hearing a buzzing sound, which was later determined to be the machine
                              delivering radiation at maximum capacity, and feeling as though someone had poured
                              hot coffee over his bath. After a few days, the patient suffered paralysis due to
                              radiation overexposure, and ultimately died of further complications. The manufacturer
                              believed the root cause was due to an electrical shock, and the machine was put back
                              into service despite an electric company verifying this was not the issue, and that
                              similar incidents had been reported to AECL before.

                              The FDA declared the Therac-25 “defective” and imposed a ban on using the machinne Therac-25.
                              Nowadays the Therac-25 is no longer used thanks to new safer technologies.
