            <p class="H-CSA-p1">
                Launched on the 5th of April, 1993, The Child Support Agency tried to implement the Child Support Act of 1991,
                which was passed to reform the legislation regarding payments for domestic maintenance in New Zealand.
                This Act enabled the parents to apply to the Inland Revenue Department and receive, if they had fulfilled all the conditions,
                child support from the Government.
                The Child Support Agency had the important role of calculating, collecting, enforcing and transferring the payment to the parents.

                The CSA's old computer system was not enough to do this operation, so they decided to use a new system, bought from EDS (Electronic Data
                System), but the problem was that while implementing this new system, the CSA was undergoing reconstruction. The Supervisors didn't actually
                care too much about all the flaws and holes in the new software, and the program was installed regardless.
            </p>
            <h3> The consequences </h3>
            <p class="H-CSA-p2"> The system crashed since the two pieces of software were incompatible, and some inevitable errors showed up. The errors resulted in over 1.9 million overpaid people, and around 700,000 people underpaid. The problems didn't stop there, here is a
            complete list:
                </p>
            <ul class="H-CSA-list">
                <li> Families were underpaid </li>
                <li> More than half of the data got stuck on the system </li>
                <li> 1.9 million people overpaid </li>
                <li> 700,000 families underpaid </li>
                <li> A total backlog of 250,000 cases </li>
                <li> 7$ billion in uncollected child support payments </li>
                <li> Only one third of the applications for child maintenace had been processed </li>
                <li> Only 4% of the applicants got the right amount </li>
            </ul>
