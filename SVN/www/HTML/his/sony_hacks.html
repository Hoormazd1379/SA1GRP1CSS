                            <h2><p> 18/12/2014 </p></h2>
                            <p> Hackers broke into the computer systems of Sony Pictures entertainment in October. The attackers stole huge swaths of confidential documents from the Hollywood studio and posted them online in the following weeks -- exposing them to everyone from potential cybercriminals to journalists who have been poring through the documents and reporting everything from the details of recent film productions to the extent of the employee data laid vulnerable on the
                               Internet.</p>

                               <h2 id="sec-title"> What Happened? </h2>
                               <p>
The Monday before Thanksgiving, Sony Pictures employees who tried to log into their computers were greeted with a graphic of a neon red skeleton featuring the words "#Hacked by #GOP," and a threat to release data later that night if an unspecified request was not met. Over the coming weeks multiple statements purported to be from GOP, short for "Guardians of Peace," were posted online, many to a text-sharing site called PasteBin, which is also used by some hactivist groups.
The messages were often accompanied by links to download huge amounts of what appears to be data from Sony Pictures' internal networks. In a memo shortly after the first leaks were obtained by the Hollywood Reporter, Sony Pictures executives Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal acknowledged the theft of a " large amount of confidential" data:</p>

<p>The same day as the attack, the FBI released a flash memo warning about a destructive type of malware. As late as this week there are reports that that Sony employees are still unable to use their old computers due to concerns that code left by the hackers may not have been completely removed from the system.</p>
<h2 id="sec-title"> What is the Social Risk of these type of attacks?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">On a Social/Societal level, there is a risk of disruption to daily life such as an impact on key services, a negative perception of technology or a drop in internal morale in organisations affected by a high-level incident.

The full list of cyber harms can be viewed online.

The researchers point to high-profile attacks against Sony, JP Morgan and online dating website Ashley Madison, as examples where a wide variety of negative outcomes were experienced, from reputational loss, causing shame and embarrassment for individuals or financial damage.</p>
