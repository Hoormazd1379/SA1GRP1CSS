                                On March 26th, more than $286 million were lost, when the Hitomi, also known as ASTRO-H, a Japanese X-ray telescope
                                disintegrated in orbit. The main cause of the disintegration is the out of control spinning, that made parts, as the solar sails
                                to came off the satellite. But what caused that?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              The Attitude Control System, on March 26th, began using the Star Tracking System to control the position of the satellite.
                              But the STT did not have updated the position monitoring system, which was essential to the satellite itself.
                              Since the two Systems contained two pieces of informations different from each other, they did not agreed on the rotatio rate
                              of the satellite. In fact, since the IRU was the most important system, the satellite program reacted in response to what the
                              IRU gives as data input. But this data was not correct, and so the satellite started spinning. Each step for the configuration
                              update system was wrong, and the satellite keeps spinning more and more, until it exceeded design parameters.
                              Each part of the satellite began to came off and the satellite disintegrated in orbit.


                              For future events, the programmers are paying more attention on the calculations that the STT has to perform, in fact the STT calculate
                              and fix the data from the IRU, but on the case of ASTRO-H, the STT just aggravate the problem, it tryied to correct a problem that actually
                              didn't exist.
