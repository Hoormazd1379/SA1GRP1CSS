                              In Zimbabwe, mobile money, the payment system based on the use of mobile phones, has become the leading transaction platform.
                              In fact, in 2017 one billion payments as well as 754 million transactions went over mobile platform. This year the value
                              of digital financial transactions has been about $ 97 billion, of which $ 18 billion went over the mobile platforms
                              (against 2016 with $ 5,8 billion).<br><br>

                              Here the most important platform is EcoCash, with more than 8 million registered users in Zimbabwe. This platform allows bill
                              payments, goods payments and micro insurance to banking services. At the beginning of July 2018, the network had crashed for
                              two days, causing a lot of difficulties to many consumer businesses. EcoCash has explained that the problem was caused by
                              a programmed update of the system.<br><br>

                              This crash caused a strong impact to the local economy; supermarkets and other stores were full of goods that could not be paid for.<br><br>

                              Unfortunately, the government of Zimbabwe has not been able to quantify the economic damage in the country, already with so many
                              economic difficulties. Now the debate is about the real risk of loss of money when a big platform crashes, some people have suggested
                              bitcoin as a solution to avoid these risks.
