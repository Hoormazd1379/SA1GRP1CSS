                              "The Nest Learning Thermostat is dead to me, literally. Last week, my once-beloved smart
                              thermostat suffered from a mysterious software bug that drained its battery and sent our home
                              into a chill in the middle of the night.

                              <br>Although I had set the thermostat to 70 degrees overnight, my wife and I were woken by a
                              crying baby at 4 a.m. The thermometer in his room read 64 degrees, and the Nest was off."

                              <br>This didn’t happen to just Nick Bilton, a Nest customer. The problems with the much-hyped thermostat, which allows
                              users to monitor and adjust their thermostats on their smartphones, affected an untold number
                              of customers when the device went haywire across America.<br>The bug drained the battery life of thermostats and deactivated the system.

                          <p>Small glitches can cause huge problems.<br>
                              For those who are elderly or ill, or who have babies, a freezing house can have dire health consequences.
                              Moreover, homeowners who installed a Nest in a weekend home, or who were on vacation, were also concerned
                              that their pipes could freeze and burst, causing major damage.

                        </div>
                          <p>Nest said the issue had since been fixed for 99.5% of its customers. And to be fair, the
                            company’s tech support has been working hard to help users who are affected. But the fix can require customers
                            to follow a nine-step procedure to manually restart the thermostat, which involves detaching the device from the wall,
                            charging it with a USB cable for 15 minutes, reattaching it to the wall, pressing a series of buttons, charging it again
                            for at least an hour, and then... It should work!!! (You can find google nest support
