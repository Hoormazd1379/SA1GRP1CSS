<u>Mt.Gox:</u> <br>
Mt. Gox was a website for making bitcoin transactions. It was launched in 2010 and 4 years later it held 70% of all bitcoin transactions on the planet. During its growth, the company faced several difficulties that heralded a future disaster. Thanks to two majority shareholders who helped a lot the company, Mt.Gox managed to overcome these difficulties until the day of the beginning of the end.

                        <p>
                    <br>   <u> What happened:</u><br>
                            
The first problems occurred in 2011 when a violation of the security of Mt.Gox caused the sudden drop in the nominal value of bitcoins.

<p>                        
2 May 2013 <br>
CoinLab filed a $75 million lawsuit against Mt.Gox.

                        <p>
May 15 2013 <br>
The US Department of Homeland Security issued a warrant to seize money from one of its support company that was not allowed to operate legally.
</p>
                        <p>
June 2013 <br>
Mt.Gox's dollar withdrawals were suspended because a bank blocked the company's accounts. 
</p> <p>
During this period of time the complaints of dissatisfied and angry customers were many. 
In 2014, initially Mt.Gox stopped all bitcoin withdrawals putting thousands of users on hold. 
The value of Bitcoins on this platform dropped considerably compared to the others. 
A number of other factors caused the site to close and Mt.Gox announced the loss of $450 million. 
The causes of the disappearance of bitcoins were never clarified. The cause of the disappearance of bitcoins is mainly related to the poor security of the computer system of Mt.Gox, some hackers over time have exploited the weaknesses of the system to steal money. 
The creditors at Mt. Gox's were about 130,000 in February 2014 Mt.Gox's website went offline permanently. Other trading sites have released communications claiming to distance themselves from Mt.Gox.

                    <br>     <p>In this article published on March 15 2019 by               the New York Times are explained the legal                   consequences to the former head of Mt.Gox:
                        <br>
                            “TOKYO — A Tokyo court handed down a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence on Friday to the former head of Mt. Gox, a cryptocurrency exchange that helped establish Bitcoin as a household name before spectacularly imploding amid allegations of mismanagement.
Still, Mark Karpelès, the French national who presided over Mt. Gox’s rise to become the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, will not serve additional time if he remains on good behavior.
The verdict ended a more-than-five-year ordeal for Mr. Karpelès, who was found guilty on a charge of falsifying data but innocent of two additional charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He was arrested in August 2015 and held for almost a year in detention, where he spent months under interrogation by prosecutors who upped the pressure by adding more charges against him.
His sentence was suspended for four years, effectively meaning he will serve no additional jail time as long as he remains on good behavior.”
