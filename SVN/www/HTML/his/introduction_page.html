            Since the existence of Softwares, we are fighting against the problem that, unavoidably at some point,
            one or more errors will show up on the running Software,
            and the biggest fear that we have is that we cannot predict how bad the consequences will be.
            <br>
            <br>
            In History, there are thousands of events that already showed us how bad and catastrophic an event can be,
            even if caused by the smallest error in Programming.

        <ul class="H-intro-list">
            <li class="H-intro-list-title">The consequences can be divided as follows:</li>
            <li> Financial Impact </li>
            <li> Casualties </li>
            <li> Social Impact </li>

            <td class="H-intro-table-td">Each category has an impact, and even if the number of casualties seems more important and catastrophic,
                the other categories may be devastating for us too, as we’ll see in the next sections.
                Since the role of software is present in multiple areas of our everyday life, knowing the weaknesses and the inevitable errors in
                the Softwares could save us from catastrophic consequences;

            <td class="H-intro-table-td">
                but as you will see, history showed us that, each step towards predicting
                the errors in a Software that we are doing, is actually not enough to completely stop errors that may cause more catastrophic events in the future.
                So in other words, this timeline will not have an end, unfortunately.
