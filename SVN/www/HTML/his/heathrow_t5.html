                                So everyone in the plane
                                just watched as all their suitcases were taken back into the terminal instead of being loaded on."
                                A passenger during a BBC interview.

                                After long time spending on planning and constructing the Terminal 5 of the London Heathrow Airport,
                                no one had doubts about the big future of the T5 and its success. But sometimes, little problems may
                                cause a lot of financial damage.
