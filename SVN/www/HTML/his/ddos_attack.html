                                In January 2017, the Lloyds Banking Group and other banks in the UK fell victim to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that persisted over a two-day period. DoS describes an attack where systems are bombarded with illegitimate data or requests, and therefore become unable to respond to legitimate requests (e.g., for a webpage or service access) in a timely manner (Nurse, 2018). In this instance, the financial institutions were attacked by a distributed DoS (DDoS) in which the illegitimate requests originated from multiple, dynamically changing locations. The Lloyds group were one of the most significantly targeted banks during this attack, and attack impacts included system unavailability and limited online service access for its customers.

                            <h2 id="sec-title"> Social impact of (DoS) attack </h2>
                            <p>
At the broad social and societal levels, the attack affected millions of bank customers. According to reports, perpetrators attempted to block access to the bankâ€™s 20 million UK accounts (Collinson, 2017). The result was an impact on individuals and businesses, particularly their ability to login to online systems. As such, some customers would have been unable to view balances, make payments (e.g., for rent and bills), and conduct bank transfers (e.g., for necessary one-off transactions).

<p> Another pertinent factor here was that this type of DDoS attack targeting the banking sector had occurred in the past.</p>
