For about 30 minutes on 2 July 2019 at 05:50 pm, visitors to Cloudflare sites received 502 errors
("Bad Gateway") due to a global outage across network, caused by a massive spike in CPU
utilization on our network. This CPU spike was
caused by a bad software deploy that was rolled back. Once rolled back the service
returned to normal operation and all domains using Cloudflare returned to normal
traffic levels.
