            On August 14 2003, a power outage affected the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, together with
            the Canadian province of Ontario. It took between two days and one or two weeks for power to be completely
            restored. An estimated 10 million people in Canada and 45 million people in the United States were affected
            by this blackout, and what should have been just a local blackout, spread to over eight U.S. states and Southern
            and Central Ontario.

            <p class="H-BLACKOUT-p2">
            The primary cause was a software bug in the alarm system at the control roomn of FirstEnergy. In summary, the
            bug didn't made possible to restablish the energy after overloaded trasmission lines dropped into foliage,
            and so the Blackout was worst.The program was resonsible for checking if the power supply and the loads remain
            balanced. With this, computer systems assits those opretations, by predicting an overload and analyze the
            state of their network. The software bug was discovered to be the race condition bug, that existed in General Electri
            Energy's Unix-based XA/21 energy management system. The bug made every alerts for important changes in system state
            inexistent for the System operators.

            <p class="H-BLACKOUT-p3">
            Other than just creating difficulties for people to do their everyday actions, the blackout of 2003 prompted the Government
            to include a provision for reliability in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Each Elentricity providers in U.S. must succeed
            the standards od the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The blackout also lead to changes in the U.S. national
            energy policy and also homeland security. In fact, during the blackout, no system would detect illegal border crossing
            ,port landings or hacking attemts to vulnerable sites. This led to a considerable fear that in future some blackouts, will
            lead to terrorist attack, without any security. The idea of implementing also solar panels, were taken into consideration,
            and maybe on the future we'll some progress regarding the implementation of solar energy as a source of energy in case of
            blackouts.
