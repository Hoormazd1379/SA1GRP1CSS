                              On February 25 1991, during the Gulf war there has been a programming error in a Patriot defence system belonging to U.S., in fact it failed to properly track a missile launched (Scud) from Iraq causing the death of 28 U.S. soldiers and almost one hundred others were wounded.
                              This error was already present in all of the Patriots deployed in the region, however "the presence of the bug was masked by the fact that a particular Patriot weapons control computer had to be continuously running for several days before the bug could cause the hazard of a failure to track a missile". In this case:

                              <textarea class="H-PATRIOT-textarea">"The software problem led to an inaccurate tracking calculation that became worse the longer the system operated" and states that "at the time of the incident, the [Patriot] had been operating continuously for over 100 hours" by which time "the inaccuracy was serious enough to cause
                              the system to look in the wrong place [in the radar data] for the incoming missile."
                            </textarea>
                            </p>

                            <p class="H-PATRIOT-p3">
                              The investigations has been made by the GAO (the U.S. General Accounting Office) and it reported that every hour of uptime there was an accumulating error of .003433 seconds, and this error of time was in common of all Patriots, then it wasn't a specific failure of one defence system.
                              The office at the Army Missile Command responsible for the Patriot created an improved software program and the Army technical experts added a fix to correct the targeting imprecision.
