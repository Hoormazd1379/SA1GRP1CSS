                              <u>Worm:</u> <br>
                              Worm is a malware that can replicate itself and spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread by exploiting security errors on the target computer to access it. Many Worms are only designed to spread and do not change the systems they pass through, but some (such as the Morris Worm) are able to cause damage such as network outages and other unwanted effects.

                            <u> What happened:</u><br>
                            In 1988 the Morris Worm, one of the first computer worms distributed via the internet, was distributed.
                            Initially it was not designed to do damage, but to highlight security flaws. The mistake that led the Worm to be harmful was in the diffusion mechanism. The Worm had the task of copying itself even if it was already present on the device once out of seven. This parameter proved excessive and spread rapidly, infecting thousands of computers. The damage was not accurately estimated but it is thought that it may have reached up to $10 million in damage.
                            This Malware is also linked to the first conviction for hacking in the United States of America.
                            Many experts in the field were needed to fight the worm, they worked to prevent it from spreading again and to remove it from the machines.

                       This article written in 2008 by Carolyn Duffy Marsan for the New York Times, allows you to understand the environment in which the Morris Worm was spread:

                       <textarea class="H-MWORM-article">       “Considered the first major attack on the 'Net, the Morris worm served as a wake-up call to the Internet engineering community about the risk of software bugs, and it set the stage for network security to become a valid area of research and development.
       "The biggest implication of the Morris worm was that the Internet was very small ... and it was considered a friendly place, a clubhouse," Allman says. "This [attack] made it clear that there were some people in that clubhouse who didn't have the best interests of the world in mind ... This made it clear we had to think about security."”
