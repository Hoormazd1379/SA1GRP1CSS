                A CPR-Number is the Danish form of personal identification. On the one hand it can be used for the government to identify each specific person, but on the other hand it can also be used to to register formal documents. For example, it has been demonstrated by just having the CPR-Number of a person, a stranger can create
                an ID-card if service workers are sloppy, which happens. Therefore, it is possible to change registered data about the specific person, and even create a bank account in their name. <br><br>
                Naturally, that means that CPR-Numbers should be kept private. However, in 2014 the Danish state accidentally leaked more 900.000 CPR-Numbers, almost a sixth of the Danish population at the time. The error came from the company Gilling ApS which was in charge of handling sensitive date from the state regarding
                properties of citizens. However, an unknown error caused them to publicice a file containing not just the names and addresses as it was supposed to, but also CPR-Numbers. <a href="../bibliography/bib_text_his.html" target="_blank"><sup> (10) </sup></a>

                This event helped spark a fear of identity theft in Denmark. As the list contained both names, addresses and CPR-Numbers of citizins, it would make the job of an impersonator much simpler. The file was available to 600 companies, and luckely only 16 managed to download the file before it was taken down, but it is
                still currently unknown if all companies have deleted the file. <a href="../bibliography/bib_text_his.html" target="_blank"><sup> (10) </sup></a>
