				</div>

				<p>Since the OS provides an interface between applications and hardware and acts to share system resources between different programs, it is very likely that there are numerous errors. Perhaps the most common is a technical problem that occurs when the operating system attempts to access an incorrect memory address, perhaps due to a programming error.</p>
				<p>In this type of crash, the operating system such as Windows, Mac OS, iOS (for Apple mobile devices) or Android has failed in some way. With an operating system crash, none of the applications work and the computer has stopped working, even though the power and hardware are functioning.</p>
				<p>With an operating system crash, your computer or device may be completely unresponsive to anything, such as the mouse click, keyboard stroke or screen tap. In this case, a power shutdown and power on restart is necessary and often solves the problem since a power shut down and restart results in a reboot of the operating system and enables the computer to function properly. </p>
				<p> There are other problems that are caused by bugs that allow you to write information to a memory buffer that is too small to accept it. Additional data "overflows" from the buffer and overwrites information in memory that damages the state of the operating system. These same errors can occur in application programs. The operating system can also crash abnormally when it fails to properly manage system resources. It may happen that the operating system reaches a deadlock state, in which several programs each have control of a resource that another program needs and each one waits for the other to renounce control of the resource. As an option, the system could switch back and forth between some programs, each of which needs a significant portion of memory resources. Since switching takes time, it is possible for the machine to freeze, which means that it takes so long to swap programs back and forth that little or no production processing occurs.</p>
				<p>Lastly, an operating system can crash if the information it needs is damaged on the disk and it happens especially when the computer stops abnormally, loses power or is turned off without having the opportunity to write the contents of the memory to the appropriate files.</p>
				<p>Another possible crash is when the operating system fails to correctly recover the memory when the programs stop and consequently there is a memory leak. Over time, the internal accounting of the operating system will show that there is little memory available</p>
				<p> Consider a situation where the system actually crashes. It is supposed to have an incorrect code in the operating system that is activated because something unusual has been done. As soon as you connect a device to the USB socket of your computer that has a faulty driver, the bug is activated. What does the CPU do? It detects that event and reports it to the same piece of code used in the event of an application crash. Meanwhile the operating system detects the nature of this error and realizes that its code is the source of the problem. The system hangs to prevent more drastic failures, such as corrupting user data.</p>
				<p> An operating system bug can corrupt some data that is not used for hours or even days until it stops abnormally</p>
