				<h2>What is a Logic Error? </h2>
				<p>Logic bugs are closely related to the operational logic of the program and therefore are the most difficult to identify; in fact if you want to compile a program, the compiler does not identify any error, from the moment in which it has no reason to report them as erroe because the program is semantically and syntactically correct; this does not mean that our program is "logically" correct, in fact in many cases the final result does not correspond to what we expected, so it is up to the programmer to locate them. </P>

<p> These bugs can be caused by different events such as: the lack of understanding of the problem to be calculated or the constraints that the input data must respect, or even in the evaluation of the algorithm test. The result we get does not match what we wanted because of this error and to solve it we have to use the debugger. </p>
<p> A fairly trivial example is when we divide a number by zero or when we use a variable, which we never defined before, syntactically it is correct, but we have the error during the execution of the program, which stops. </p>

<p> They can be caused by the lack of understanding of the problem to be calculated or by the constraints that the input data must respect, or even in the evaluation of the algorithm test. These errors generally lead to the design of an algorithm that does not provide the required output in one or more instances of the problem to be solved and to find it you need to use the debugger. </P>

				<h2 id="categories"> OBOE</h2>
				<p>An OBOE means off-by-one error and is also commonly known as OBOB (off-by-one bug). It is a logical error, which involves the discrete equivalent of a boundary condition. It often happens that it happens during the programming of a computer, that is when there is an iterative cycle that flows once too often or once too little. This problem could arise when a programmer makes mistakes such as the use of "is less than or equal to" where "is less than" should have been used in a comparison or does not take into account the fact that a sequence starts from zero instead of one ( as with array indexes in many languages). This can also happen in a mathematical context, which we will see immediately.</p>
				<h3> Fencepost errors</h3>
				<p> A fencepost error is a specific type of an off-by-one-error. We can understand better if we take an example: consider a fence 30 meters long and every 3 meters you have to put a pole, the question that arises is: how many poles do we need?</p> <center>
					<img src="../../assets/bug_imgs/fencepost_error.png" style="filter: invert(1);">
				</center>
				<p>We could say at first that the answer is 10, but it is wrong since we have 11 seats. If we want to broaden and generalize the concept; the problem can be exposed as follows: if there are n places, how many sections are there between them? To answer this question we must consider that there are three possibilities. The first, in which the answer is n-1 if and only if you have an open mail line, while it will be n if the mail line forms a circle and finally we have n + 1 if the messages are not at the end of the barrier. Therefore the errors of Fencepost come from the closed count of the spaces that are between the various objects. </p>
<p> The Fencepost error can refer to an error caused by unexpected regularities in the input values, which could completely counteract a function. This error can lead to the difference between expected behaviors and worst cases of an algorithm. In these cases accuracy is essential to avoid committing an OBOE that could lead to disastrous effects.</p>

				<h2>Infinite loops and infinite recursion</h2>
				<p>The difference between an infinite loop and an infinite recursion is that the infinite recursion is a special case of an infinite loop; then the question arises what is an infinite loop? An infinite loop (or infinite loop) is a sequence of instructions in a computer program that repeats itself over and over, since the
cycle does not have a termination condition (because it does not have one that can never be satisfied) or one that restarts the cycle. With older operating systems, loops caused the entire operating system to fail to respond, but now with the prevailing preventive multitasking model, infinite loops make the program consume all the processor's available time, even though it can usually be closed by the user. Busy waiting loops are sometimes also called "infinite loops", which could cause the computer to crash or even block it; others, however, include thrashing, deadlocks and access violations. Instead the recursive cycle refers to a method to define the functions in which the function to be defined is applied within its own definition. In the first image you can see an example of an infinite loop, while the second image is an example of a recursion cycle.</p>
