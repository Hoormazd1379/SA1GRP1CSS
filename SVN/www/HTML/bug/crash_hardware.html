				</div>

				<p>A hardware crash happens when a physical device inside or attached to the computer fails, causing the entire computer to crash. For example, if the hard disk drive (the device responsible for containing all of your computer's data) fails, the computer will become mostly unusable. There is also an another possibility that the computer crashes and it is if there are any corrupt files.</p>
				<p> Understanding which driver is causing the error is very difficult and therefore it is more convenient to reinstall common system drivers like Graphics and Motherboard.</p>
				<p>To fix a hardware crashes it's necessary to replace the component that failed. If the failed part is the hard drive on a desktop or laptop, your data could be lost if you didn't have any backup. Hard drives are replaceable and the operating system and application programs can be reinstalled (as long as you have the license for the software), but personal data can never be replaced, so backups are always important </p>
				<h2> RAM</h2>
				<p> The CPU, as the RAM can fail because of an excessive use of the latter that overheat and in case of RAM  his values stores get corrupted unpredictably and then it causes random system crashes. Computer fans can help prevent this type of crash, but they could also fail. They allow the flow of cooling air, but dirt also enters that could cause intermittent short circuits, despite this is not a big problem since the compressed air is easily freed of dirt. However, other hardware problems require software testing or component replacement.</p>
				<h2> Disk computer</h2>
				<p> There may also be errors on computer disks, in which the related sectors may record information that through errors may lose all the data they had stored. In the event that they have information about the system, they could cause a crash.</p>
				<p> To better understand how it works, let's take a simple example, which we will see in the software crash below the picture.
