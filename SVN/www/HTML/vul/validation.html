    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Improper input validation Is one of the most common vulnerabilities that can create fatal failure in software.
                  So what is input validation?<br>
                  In a software in order to avoid any kinds of data flow one need to validate input correctly. So, when one has improper input validation the software has a hard time checking the inputs, which in consequence makes the software vulnerable.
                  The Validation of data is very essential, because in software validation of forms reduces the chance of hack attacks and also avoids unintential software crashes. So, if dta is validated improperly it can lead to one of these and cause software failure.
                  There are several reasons of improper input validation. These are:

  <li><a class="link" href="#2">Improper method of validation </a></li>
  <li><a class="link" href="#3">Validator issues </a></li>
  <li><a class="link" href="#4">Outdated Logic of validation </a></li>
  <li><a class="link" href="#5">Action Form</a></li>
  <li><a class="link" href="#6">Disabled Validator</a></li>
</ol>

  <a class="link" id="1"><h2>Shared Names of Forms </h2></a>
  <p >This problem occurs when 2 or more forms has the same name, which leads to increase susceptibility to attacks of some forms. Why? Because Validator only validates one of the form with the same name and ingnores others, which makes another(s) forms more vulnerable. </p>

  <a class="link" id="2"><h2>Improper method of validation</h2></a>
  <p >Some classes in a software may not support forms of validation and in order to avoid problems super validate form should be used. If super validate forms is not used then some classes will not be validated and will be more susceptibile to attacks and software will be more vulnerable</p>

  <a class="link" id="3"><h2>Validator</h2></a>
  <p >In validation process it is essential to all forms to be validated by forms defined by Validator, otherwise forms which does not support Validator will be weak places of a software. Moreover, a possible problem may occur when not all the fields are validated, because Validator requires all fields to be validated even the unuesed fields as well. </p>

  <a class="link" id="4"><h2>Outdated Logic of validation</h2></a>
  <p > The logic of validation should always be updated. There are several consequencese when validation is out of date. One of them are forms with no fields, which may lead to software crus.Moreover, when validation logic is outdated that means that validation is unavailabe, which makes forms more susceptibile to attacks and software becomes more vulnerable. So, it is essential for programmers to update validation logic.  </p>

  <a class="link" id="5"><h2>Action Form</h2></a>
  <p >Actions forms have their own form define by "Action Form Mapping". So, this form is the supported by Validator then Action forms will stay unvalidated, which will make ur program mor vulnerable.</p>

  <a class="link" id="6"><h2>Disabled Validator</h2></a>
  <p >The problem can occur when the Validator is turned off. That can happen when action form disables it. It is very dangerous if Validator is disabled, because validator validates all the forms in a software.</p>

           <h2>Consequences</h2>
           <p>The attacker is sometimes able to read the memory, causing <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulConfidentiality">loss of confidentiality</a> and leading to data leaks, or even write to memory leading to <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulIntegrity">loss of integrity</a>.</p>
           <p>Another possible consequence is <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulDenialOfService">denial of service</a>.</p>

           <h2>Detection</h2>
           <p>Scanning the software with <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulDynamicAnalysis">dynamic analysis</a> and <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulFuzzing">fuzzing</a> are both highly cost-efficient ways of checking for improper input validation, even if <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulSpotchecking">manual spotchecks</a> and <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulManualCodeReview">manual code reviews</a> reviews are often enough to find an anomaly.</p>

         <div class="VulTypeWhite">
           <h2>Mitigation</h2>
           <p>There are several mitigations of Improper Input Validation. One of them is to use Strut or OWASP ESAPI Validation API to validate data.</p>
