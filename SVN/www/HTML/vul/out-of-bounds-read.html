    <h1> Out of Bounds Read</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
<p> Out of Bounds read is type of vulnerability that may happen in a software when it reads data from the buffer (place where physical memory is stored) and reads the data out of its bounds.
  </p>
  <h2>Potention causes</h2>
  <p > There are several causes that can trigger Buffer over-read. These are:  </p>
    <ul style="color: #FFFFFF;">
     <li> Ordinary Bugs</li>
    <li>Malicious Inputs</li>
    <li>Heartbleed bug(Caused by <a class="link" href="file:///Users/bahrami/GroupProject/www/HTML/vul/validation.html#2"> Improper Input Validation)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Where this can happen</h2>
    <p>This can mainly happen in C or C++, because function in these languages does not check memory bounds they use. Moreover, it is crucial to know  some function, which are bounded in memory use
    by mistake can cause Buffer over read.</p>
    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <p>When there esists  an Out of bound vulnerability then it can lead to the leak of very important information, for intance passwords. Moreover it can lead to the crash of. <br>
    Why?
  <br> Because software can read so much data that program can cause buffer over-flow, which leads to system crash. </p>
