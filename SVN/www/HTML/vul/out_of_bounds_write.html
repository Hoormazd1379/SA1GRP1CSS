    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Out of Bounds write is a type of vulnerability that happen when a software writes data outside of the current buffer (where physical memory is stored) where it was initialy planned to.</p>
    <p>This vulnerability mostly occurs in Assembly, C and C++.<sup><a class="VulDef" href="../bibliography/bib_text_vul.html">(23)</a></sup></p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>There are two main <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulTypes">Variant type</a> vulnerabilities of out of bounds write: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE 121) and Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE 122).</p>
    <h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
    <p>Stack-based buffer overflow (or stack overflow) is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function).</p>
    <p>This vulnerability is not to be confused with stack exhaustion, usually a result from an excessively recursive function call.<sup><a class="VulDef" href="../bibliography/bib_text_vul.html">(24)</a></sup></p>
    <h2>Heap Overflow</h2>
    <p>Heap-based buffer overflow (or heap overflow) is a condition where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc().<sup><a class="VulDef" href="../bibliography/bib_text_vul.html">(25)</a></sup></p>

           <h2>Consequences</h2>
           <p> Write out of bounds can lead to several problems like troubles in code launching and errors in data, such as the modification of memory (<a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulIntegrity">loss of integrity</a>).</p>
           <p> Moreover, a program may refer to memory locations which are not in the boundaries of current buffer and that may lead to software failure (<a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulAviability">loss of aviability</a>).</p>

         <h2>Detection</h2>
         <p>This weakness can often be detected using automated <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulStaticAnalysis">static analysis</a> tools. Many modern tools use data flow analysis or constraint-based techniques to minimize the number of false positives.</p>
         <p>It may also prove useful to use <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulFuzzing">fuzzing</a> or other <a class="VulDef" href="index.html#VulDynamicAnalysis">dynamic</a> tools. </p>

           <h2>Mitigation</h2>
           <p>There are several ways to mitigate this problem. However, most of them only may help partially, but there is a universal solution.<br>
            It is the usage of languages, such as Java, that do not support such vulnerability.
