            The Internet is a dangerous place. Millions of hacks, scams, malware or in general theft of confidential
            information of users happen daily.<br>
            The recent proliferation of devices, from Smartphones to Computers to any kind of electronic device, has opened everyone up
            to even greater risks.<br>
            But there is no need to terrify. By following a couple of security measures, the exposure to any kind of Malicious Code
            is greatly reduced.
            <br><br>
            Creating complex, strong and unique passwords for your accounts is essential to being protected from Malicious attacks.<br>
            Launching a Multi-factor Authentication to your device is important too. Multi-factor Authentication means multiple pieces
            of information are combined so as to verify your identity. So, to log into an account you may need to enter a code that
            is sent to your phone, as well as your password or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_ID"class="mal-a">Face ID</a>-
            <a href="https://www.synaptics.com/technology/security-suite"class="mal-a">Fingerprint</a>.
            <br>
            After making sure that the logins are safe, connections must be too.
            Hence why users are suggested to use any kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"class="mal-a">Virtual Private Network </a>(VPN)<br>
            <br>
            "Measure" your clicks. Many of today's online threads are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing"class="mal-a">phishing</a>.
            Being a "selective clicker" means that you should avoid putting any confidential information in any kind of pop-up or
            suspicious websites  or even reply to suspicious emails or text messages for the good of your personal data.<br>
            <br>
            Lastly, every Internet user should <a href="https://cyware.com/category/malware-and-vulnerabilities-news"class="mal-a">be on the lookout for new scams</a>.
            This means staying informed about all kinds of Malicious
            Attacks.

        <br><br><br><br><br>

        <p>
            Browsing the Internet can turn out to be very dangerous.<br>
            Users are suggested not to browse to unknown sites that increase the risk of getting infected with malware.<br>
            Downloading files and clicking lines must be done only on trusted sources.<br>
            Users should also log out of sites when they are done using them.
            Logging into a site creates a cookie in the browse and, if stolen, can compromise your device's and personal data.<br>
            Last but not least, being aware of pop up ads that are able to harm your device is essential.
            You are suggested to avoid clicking into these ads but close pop-ups from the system tray area with a right mouse click.
