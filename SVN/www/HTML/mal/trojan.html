            A Trojan Horse, or Trojan is a wide spectrum of malwares that misleads the victim of its true intent. The name comes from the well known story of the Trojan Horse, in which the horse full of soldiers, thought to be a gift, was used to make the city of Troy fall. Unlike <a href="virus.html" class="mal-a">viruses</a> and <a href="worm.html" class="mal-a">worms</a>, trojan usually do not try to inject themselves into other files.
            <a href="ransomware.html" class="mal-a">Ransomwares</a> attacks are often spread using a Trojan.<br>
            As we said, trojans cover a wide spectrum of malwares, we can say it is a wat to deliver a malware, therefore its uses may vary. Older versions of Internet Explorer and Google Chrome had some security issues and some Trojan took advantage of that; they used the infected computer's internet for illegal purposes and this way the infected machine could have potentially been incriminating, because all the evidence would have pointed to that IP address.

            A <a href="spyware.html" class="mal-a">spyware</a> used by the government is called a govware, which are usually carried out by trojans, used to intercept communications from the target's computer. <br>
            While today many Trojans are still used to infect as many users as possible, a more targeted approach is becoming the new trend. Many Trojans we hear about today are designed to have a specific target, which can be a company, and organization and even a government.

                Magic Lantern is a <a href="keylogger.html" class="mal-a">keystroke logging software</a> developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and can be installed remotely by an e-mail attachment of by exploiting common operating systems vulnerabilities.<br>
                There are concerns about whether an anti-virus should detect the FBI keystroke logger.
                The problem is that it is uncertain how much of a potential Magic Lantern has and whether hackers could use it outside the jurisdiction of the law.
                For example a technology consultant at Sophos, a security software company, stated: "Our costumers are paying us for a service, to protect them from lla form of malicious code, so we do not and will not make any exceptions for law enforcement malware of other tools.". CNET News has surveyed 13 other security companies about their contacts and level of cooperation with the law enforcement and none of them confirmed that their products cover up government installed malewares.
