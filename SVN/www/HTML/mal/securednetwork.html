<p><font size="5"> Most operating systems allow you to create multiple user accounts on your computer,
   so that different users can have different settings.
   These user accounts can also be set up to have different security settings.
   Administrators usually have the ability to install new software while non-administrative typically do not.
   Users are suggested to use a "limited" or "standard" user account whenever possible.
    Doing this can help prevent malware from getting installed on your computer and making system-wide changes.
