          A Worm is a standalone type of malicious software program whose primary function is to infect other computers while remaining active on infected systems. <br>
          It spreads itself using a computer network, relying on security failures. <br>
          Some can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic, while others use parts of an operating system that are automatic and invisible to the user. <br>
          It is common for worms to be noticed only when their uncontrolled replication consumes system resources, slowing or halting other tasks. <br>
          Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. <br>
          However, even these payload-free worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects. <br>

              ILOVEYOU is one of the most well-known and destructive viruses of all time. <br>
              In 2000, it was such a myth that malware could get away with being completely unsubtle. <br>
              The virus came in an email with a subject line that said I love you. <br>
              Being curious types, people clicked into the email with aplomb-regardless of the fact the email was not from anyone they knew. <br>
              The malware was a worm that was downloaded by clicking on an attachment called LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs . <br>
              The worm overwrote system and personal files and spread itself over and over again. <br>
              It was so effective it actually held the Guinness World Record as the most virulent virus of all time. <br>
              Two young Filipino programmers, Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman, were named as the perps but because there were no laws against writing malware, their case was dropped and they went free. <br>
