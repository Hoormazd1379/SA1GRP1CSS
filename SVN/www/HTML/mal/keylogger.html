            Keylogging is the action of recording the keys pressed on a keyboard, usually with the person using the keyboard being unaware of being monitored. This can be achived with either a software or an hardware. <br>
            The programs themselves are not illegal, they are in fact often used by employers to check the use of their computer. However keyloggers are most often used in illegal ways, with the goal of stealing confidential informations or passwords. Usually the law says that if the person installing the keylogger owns the device, then its use is perfectly legal.
            The risk comes when there are malicious actors behind the keylogger.

            As we said, there are two types of keyloggers; the hardware type and the software type. For the first one, physical access to the computer is needed for the cybercriminal to attach it,
            therefore this type is less common than the other. Software keyloggers are much easier to introduce and install. Unlike other kinds of malwares, 
            keyloggers do not make a threat to the machine they are installed in. In fact their goal is to get the information needed without being noticed. 
            While they are not a threat to the hardware, they are definetely a threat to the user.

                During the cold war a keylogger allowed the Soviet Union to spy on US diplomats. This was probably the world's first case of a keylogger. It consisted in a small device implanted in some US diplomats' IBM Selectric typewriters. The highly miniaturized circuits where hidden into a metal bar inside the typewriter, making them invisible to the naked eye. With the exception of spaces and tabs, the tiny devices had the ability to record every single key pressed and transmit it back to the spies in real time. The devices were found inside 16 typewriters used from 1976 to 1984, meaning that they operated for 8 yers potentially. Since they operate for so long it is hard to quantify the damage done. <br>
                The device worked by measuring magnetic energy: The movement of the "bail", a mechanical arm that controlled the writing, had a unique binary movement corresponding to each character. The magnetic energy was picked up by the sensors in the bar and was converted into a digital signal, which a transmitter in the bar would send out to a sensor. This devices could be turned off to avoid detection when it was known that inspection teams were checking nearby. It is not surprising that Soviet embassies opted to use manual typewriters over electric ones to type confidential papers.
