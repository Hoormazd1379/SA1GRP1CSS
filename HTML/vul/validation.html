  <h1>Improper Input Validation</h1>
  <h2> Why validation is needed</h2>
  <p id="vul-p">Validation is an essential part of making a software and there are good reasons for that. One of the primary reason of validation is to reduce vulnerability of a software from hack attacks, which may lead to software failure. This webpage will look throw Improper Input Validation</p>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p id="vul-p">Improper input validation Is one of the most common vulnerabilities that can create fatal failure in software.
                So what is input validation.
                In a software in order to avoid any kinds of data flow one need to validate input correctly. So, when one has improper input validation the software has hard time checking the inputs, which in consequence makes one's software vulnerable.
                There are several reasons of improper input validation. These are:
  
  <ol id="num1">
    <a class="link" href="#1"><li> Shared names of Forms </li></a>
    <a class="link" href="#2"><li> Improper method of validation </li></a>
    <a class="link" href="#3"><li> Validator issues </li></a>
    <a class="link" href="#4"><li>Outdated Logic of validation </li></a>
    <a class="link" href="#5"><li>Action Form</li></a>
    <a class="link" href="#6"><li>Disabled Validator</li></a>

    <a class="link" id="1"><h2>Shared Names of Forms </h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p">This problem occurs when 2 or more forms has the same name, which leads to increase susceptibility to attacks of some forms. Why ? Because Validator only validates one of the form with the same name and ingnores others, which makes another(s) forms more vulnerable. </p>

    <a class="link" id="2"><h2>Improper method of validation</h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p">Some classes in a software may not support forms of validation and in order to avoid problems super validate form should be used. If super validate forms is not used then some classes will not be validated and will be more susceptibile to attacks and software will be more vulnerable</p>

    <a class="link" id="3"><h2>Validator</h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p">In validation process it is essential to all forms to be validated by forms defined by Validator, otherwise forms which does not support Validator will be weak places of a software. Moreover, a possible problem may occur when not all the fields are validated, because Validator requires all fields to be validated even the unuesed fields as well. </p>

    <a class="link" id="4"><h2>Outdated Logic of validation</h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p"> The logic of validation should always be updated. There are several consequencese when validation is out of date. One of them are forms with no fields, which may lead to software crus.Moreover, when validation logic is outdated that means that validation is unavailabe, which makes forms more susceptibile to attacks and software becomes more vulnerable. So, it is essential for programmers to update validation logic.  </p>

    <a class="link" id="5"><h2>Action Form</h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p">Actions forms have their own form define by "Action Form Mapping". So, this form is the supported by Validator then Action forms will stay unvalidated, which will make ur program mor vulnerable.</p>

    <a class="link" id="6"><h2>Disabled Validator</h3></a>
    <p id="vul-p">The problem can occur when the Validator is turned off. That can happen when action form disables it. It is very dangerous if Validator is disabled, because validator validates all the forms in a software.</p>
