				<p> A crash in the program occurs when a fatal error occurs within the application software. This kind of shutdown could cause an application not to be used or the entire computer to be used. An application may cause the entire computer to crash. While operating systems try to isolate the problems of a specific application, the computer does not stop abnormally, although there may be times when it can happen.</p>
				<p>The program crashes happen for several reasons and it is usually advised not to continue using the program in question until the error has been corrected, although most of the operating systems for desktops, laptops and smartphones has a tool with which you can turn off and stop a particular program or app. It is usually possible to close the specific program and restart it to continue using it, always if the operating system is still working</p>

				<p>So let's take up the open discussion on the hardware and assume we have a program in which we consider a number between 1 and 9 to insert in it, instead we insert a name. Therefore there may come to mind a question: "What happens?". Then the program tries to use that string of characters as a number, but it doesn't work so well in fact one of the two situations manifests itself at this point:
the program continues to work but always makes a mistake: so it is up to us programmers to understand that the output we receive is not what we expect and despite this, it is important to realize that the system continues to run without interruption. </P>
<p> The program crashes abnormally with the operating system that sends an alert, "error". To understand the second mode we must briefly examine the architecture of the system, in particular the application is executed in an area created by the CPU and by the operating system so as to avoid some bugs; therefore the role of the CPU is to check if the application is executing something that it should not perform (such as, for example, exceed its limits): in the event that it happens, the CPU blocks the execution of the application and then calls the code present in the operating system to protest. This code checks what happened and displays the crash message. Whenever a program has bugs, sooner or later it will execute random or incorrect instructions. In spite of everything we can find good news: the programs are separate enough that they can't take the computer with them when they get stuck, but as always there are exceptions.</p>
