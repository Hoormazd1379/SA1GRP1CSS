				<h2>Crash Videogame</h2>
				<p>It freezes, blocks or exits the game completely. You may face a crash either in opening or during your gameplay. The game no longer progresses after a crash. You need to restart and repeat a stage again. This is also known as Crash to Desktop (CTD). This term is use when no error message is displayed. It can be triggered by anything in a game.
					While developing a game, developers are highly focused on the factors that might crash the game. It is highly prioritized on both, testers as well as developers side. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="textblockcont">
				<h2>Severe</h2>
				<p>Severe is a game bug that restricts any movement from the player, without crashing or closing of the game. For example, a door not opening that was supposed to open for the player to advance to the next room.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="textblockcont">
				<h2>General</h2>
				<p>It is a bug that does not prevent any progression in the game but rather is as a problem during gameplay. An example of this is a zombie clipped into the floor. It hinders gameplay a bit but does not stop the player from progressing. However, general bugs can annoy the player and cause problems in the game like fps drops.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="textblockcont">
				<h2>Minor</h2>
				<p>Minor bugs are not prioritized. Though these bugs can annoy player and decrease the experience of the game, they don’t restrict user to progress into the game. An example is character’s mouth not moving when spoken to. Bugs even below Minor category are declared as Trivial bugs which may remain on hold/pending forever by the developers. Especially when there are higher priority tasks to be completed in the game.
					But a perfectionist would definitely consider things even in this bug category.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="textblockcont">
				<h2>Graphic and Sound</h2>
				<p>These bugs are associated to visual and audio experience of the game. Graphics incorporate things like texture mistakes and imperfection on the objects. While sound may include the music effects associated with the gameplay.</p>

				<div style="text-align: center;"><h2>List Of Worst Bugs in Videogaming</h2></div>
				 <div style="text-align: center;";> <img style="width:750px;" src="../../assets/bug_imgs/missigno.jpg" alt="MissingNo"> <caption><h3 style="text-align: center;">Pokémon Red & Blue – MissingNo.
						</h3></caption></div> <br>
				<p> MissingNo.
					 is  one of the most famous glitch. The jumbled, pixelated mess strikes fear into plenty of gamers, as it has the ability fully break the game and distort the graphics. But it had its uses, too. A side effect of finding the glitchy Pokémon is that whatever the sixth item in your inventory was would magically be multiplied, making it an easy way to get a hundred Master Balls or Hyper Potions.
					  </p>
					 <br><div style="text-align: center;";> <img style="width:750px;border-radius: 10px;" src="../../assets/bug_imgs/unity.jpg" alt="Unity"> <caption><h3 style="text-align: center;">Assassin's Creed Unity
						</h3></caption></div> <p>One of the most famous glitch is the "faceless" PG of Assassin's Creed Unity. On the main interface after the changing of the costume, it will appear the "faceless" assassin. </p>

						<br><div style="text-align: center;";> <video controls style="width:750px;" src="../../assets/bug_imgs/gandhi.mp4" alt="Gandhi"> </video> <caption><h3 style="text-align: center;">Civilization V
							</h3></caption></div> <p>Nuclear Gandhi is the nickname given to the Indian historical figure Mahatma Gandhi as portrayed in the turn-based strategy video game series Civilization. Among the fans of the games, Gandhi has gained much notoriety for his obsessive nuclear warmongering, in stark contrast to the pacifist reputation of the real life counterpart.
									Gandhi’s obsession with nuclear bombing in the series was first noted in the sequel title Civilization II, wherein India would often evolve into the most hostile civilization during the mid to late stages of a match. Cause of this was a glitch in the artificial intelligence (A.I.) settings for Gandhi's aggression level.
									Despite starting with the lowest level of aggression to reflect Gandhi's historical legacy of pacifism, as the game progresses towards the Modern Era the Indian civilization would often become more hostile and confrontational towards other leaders as a result of a coding error.
							</p>
						<br><div style="text-align: center;";> <img style="width:750px;" src="../../assets/bug_imgs/dragonage.png" alt="Gandhi"> <caption><h3 style="text-align: center;">Dragon Edge: Inquisition
							</h3></caption></div> <p>Known online as the Banter Bug, this harmless sounding glitch doesn’t sound like it’d affect your game too much, but the most awkward thing about it is that you might not even know you’ve been bitten.
								 The characters in your party should joke among themselves and trade banter as you explore the vast game world, but the Banter Bug stops that from happening. Without knowing any better, you might play for hours and hours without noticing that your party seems unusually bereft of chat.
								 It’s great being able to hear your team interact with each other, and really helps with immersion, but the bug’s existence causes another problem altogether: paranoia. </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
