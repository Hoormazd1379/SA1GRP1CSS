					<h2> What is an OS-Crash? </h2>
				<p>Since the operating system has an interface between the applications and the hardware and also works to share the system resources between the various programs, there is a high probability that there are numerous errors. Among which we can find a technical problem that happens when the operating system tries to access an incorrect memory address, which could be caused by a programming error.</p>
				<p>In this kind of crash, the operating system such as Windows or the Mac OS failed in some way. Due to a crash of the operating system, none of the applications work, despite the power supply and the hardware working. In this type of crash, the computer may not respond to anything and therefore it is necessary to restart the power supply, which often resolves a problem, since this action allows the operating system to restart and allows the computer to function properly. </p>
				<p> There may be other problems that can be caused by bugs, which allow information to be written to a memory buffer that is too small to accept it. The additional data is excessive and therefore overwrites the information in memory, which damages the state of the operating system. These errors can occur in application programs, but even the operating system can crash abnormally, especially when it fails to organize the system resources correctly. Furthermore it may happen that the operating system reaches a deadlock state, where the various programs control a resource that another program needs and therefore everyone waits for the other to renounce the control of the resource. As a possibility, the system could switch from one program to another, each of which needs a significant part of the memory resources. since switching takes time, it is possible for the machine to freeze, which means that it takes a very long time to swap programs back and forth that little or no production processing occurs.</p>
				<p> Finally, an operating system can crash in the event that the information they need has been damaged on the disk and this happens especially when the computer stops abnormally, loses power or is turned off without the possibility to write the contents of the memory in the file.</p>
				<p>Moreover we can find another possible arrest and when the operating system is not able to recover the memory correctly, that is when the programs stop and consequently there is a memory loss. Meanwhile, the internal accounting of the operating system will show that there is little available memory. Keep in mind a situation where the system actually crashes. There should be an incorrect code that is activated because something unusual has been done. The bug is only activated as soon as you set up a USB port on the computer with a defective driver. But xosa does the CPU? This component detects that event and reports it to the same piece of code used in case of application crash. Meanwhile the operating system finds the nature of this error and realizes that its code is the source of the problem. To avoid more drastic failures such as corruption of user data, the system hangs. An operating system bug can damage some data that is not used indefinitely until it stops abnormally.</p>
