                <br>
                The Pentium FDIV bug is a computer bug that affected the first Intel Pentium processors in the mid-1990s. Intel attributed the error to the missing entries in the lookup table used by the floating-point division circuitry.

        <u> What happened:</u>
        <br>
        A university professor, in 1994,  while performing the calculations necessary for his research, was confronted with a great inequality between the expected result and that actually obtained. So he decided to verify the calculation on a machine that mounted the old processor 486. It was to his amazement that the machine gave the correct result as its answer. He informed the manufacturer, who said they were already aware of the problem and that they were working to remove the bug from the new processors. This story quickly became famous and many disgruntled customers asked for the replacement of the defective chips. The total cost caused by the massive replacement of chips cost Intel about 450 million dollars.
            In conclusion, Intel had to replace thousands of chips but was able to fix the bug that no longer occurred in later versions of the processor.

        This is an article written by New York Times at the time when the bug was becoming famous:<br>

        “An exclusive circuitry error is causing a chip used in millions of computers to generate inaccurate results in certain rare cases, heightening anxiety among many scientists and engineers who rely on their machines for precise calculations.
        The flaw, an error in division, has been found in the Pentium, the current top microprocessor of the Intel Corporation, the world's largest chip maker. The chip, in several different configurations, is used in many computers sold for home and business use, including those made by I.B.M., Compaq, Dell, Gateway 2000 and others.
        The flaw appears in all Pentium chips now on the market, in certain types of division problems involving more than five significant digits, a mathematical term that can include numbers before and after a decimal point.
        Intel declined to say how many Pentium chips it made or sold, but Dataquest, a market research company in San Jose, Calif., estimated that in 1994 Intel would sell 5.5 million to 6 million Pentiums, roughly 10 percent of the number of personal computers sold worldwide.”<a href="../bibliography/bib_text_his.html" target="_blank"><sup> (39) </sup></a>
