<u>Knight Capital Group:</u> <br>
Knight Capital Group was an American financial services company. In particular, it dealt with market making, electronic execution, institutional sales and trading.
In its golden age, Knight was the industry leader in America and was present in the United States, London, Hong Kong and China.

                            </p>
                        <p>
                       <u> What happened:</u><br>
On August 1, 2012 Knight caused a serious disruption of the stock market which resulted in a large commercial and economic loss for the company. The use of the wrong code on one of the eight SMARS servers caused a serious interruption in the prices of 148 companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Total losses were estimated at $440 million gross. As a result, Knight Capital Group shares collapsed by more than 70%. Despite many attempts to keep the company alive, the loss was too significant and the company was later purchased by Getco LLC.

                        <p>
                        Down here there is the explaination published by New York Times the day after the disaster:<br>

“$10 million a minute.
That’s about how much the trading problem that set off turmoil on the stock market on Wednesday morning is already costing the trading firm.
The Knight Capital Group announced on Thursday that it lost $440 million when it sold all the stocks it accidentally bought Wednesday morning because a computer glitch.
The losses are threatening the stability of the firm, which is based in Jersey City. In its statement, Knight Capital said its capital base, the money it uses to conduct its business, had been “severely impacted” by the event and that it was “actively pursuing its strategic and financing alternatives.”
The losses are greater than the company’s revenue in the second quarter of this year, when it brought in $289 million.
“With the events of yesterday, you have to question if this is the beginning of the end for Knight,” said Christopher Nagy, founder of the consulting firm KOR Trading.”
