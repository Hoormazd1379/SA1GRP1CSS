                            <p>Malcolm Byrd was sitting at home in 2003 when police officers came
                              to his home and arrested him on a warrant for cocaine possession.
                              Though eventually his name was cleared, Byrd learned that a criminal
                              had used his name when he was arrested. He spent some time in jail before
                              finally being released.

                              identity fraud happens when a thief gains access to personal information
                              like your name, address, credit card or bank account numbers, Social Security number, phone
                              or utility account numbers, passwords, medical insurance numbers, your email and social media
                              accounts and uses that information for their economic gain.
                              In today's cyber-focused world, the Internet is another way identity thieves can gain access to
                              this kind of informations. Whether you rely on social media for your profession or use it to stay
                              in touch with friends and family, hackers could damage your reputation or put your job on the line
                              by using your current accounts - and even creating new, fraudulent accounts - in which they post while
                              pretending to be you.<br>
                              On a more basic level, recovering from identity theft could affect personal relationships as
                              you feel all of these stressors - and also if you ask family and friends for help and financial
                              assistance while you get back on your feet.
                              Identity theft can have many lasting negative effects on its victims.
                              For example, as we saw in Malcolm Byrd case, if a thief commits a crime and provides your
                              name to police - something known as criminal identity theft - and authorities arrest you as a
                              result, well, you can imagine the resulting stress. One of the best things to do is act
                              quickly to limit its impact - and seek help. Depending on the type of ID theft, this can involve
                              reaching out to a variety of entities, including the three major credit reporting agencies, banks,
                              the Social Security Administration, the IRS, the Federal Trade Commission and law enforcement.
                              Victims who are suffering emotionally and physically also may need to seek the help of medical
                              professionals.
