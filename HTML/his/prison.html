                              More than 3,200 US prisoners have been released early in the Washington State Prison because of a software glitch.
                              The bug miscalculated the sentence reductions prisoners in Washington state had received for good behaviour.
                              It was introduced in 2002 as part of an update that followed a court ruling about applying good behaviour credits.
                              State officials said that many early-release prisoners had to return to jail to finish their sentences.

                                Washington's governor Jay Inslee at a press conference:
                                "That this problem was allowed to continue for 13 years is deeply disappointing to me, totally unacceptable and,
                              frankly, maddening"

                            <h2>The remedy</h2>

                              <p class="H-PRISON-p3">The Washington Department of Corrections (DoC) added that it was made aware of the problem in 2012 when the family
                              of one victim found out that the offender was getting out too early. The faulty software was not corrected until a new IT boss for
                              the DoC was appointed, who realised
                              how serious the problem had become.
                              The manager then informed senior staff at the DoC and the governor's office.
                              Analysis of the errors showed that prisoners whose sentences were wrongly calculated got out on average 49 days
                              early. One prisoner had his sentence cut by 600 days.
                              Local police helped to round up those who still need to spend time in jail. Five people have already been returned to cells.
                              An update that applies the correct formula for calculating sentence cuts was released the january 7th. Until then the DoC
                              had ordered not to release any prisoner without checking manually that they should be released.

                            <h2>The fear</h2>

                            <p class="H-PRISON-p4">As the world moves to become more and more reliant on digital systems, it is shocking that a mistake of this
                              caliber can be allowed to happen, especially over such a long period. Mistakes like this bring into question
                              whether we can yet truly rely on electronic systems for such important tasks, and it is fortunate that the prisons
                              have a way to manually assure the duration of sentences, else the error could have been uncorrectable. It was
                              unconfirmed whether any prisoners released early had committed crimes, but it is concerning that for the last 12 years,
                              criminals who had not seen out their full sentence could have been walking the streets of Washington.
